            <h1 class="sub-title">Character</h1>
            <p>
              I'm a final-year Computer Science student who's passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Through my studies at Eduvos and founding Themba Digital Security, I've learned to combine technical skills with strategic thinking to create meaningful solutions for healthcare, government, and community challenges.<br /><br />

              My approach is rooted in curiosity and structured problem-solving. Whether working on our Top 3 Healthcare Staff Secure solution for public hospitals or mentoring youth through robotics programming, I always ask: "How can we create solutions that truly serve people and make a measurable difference?"<br /><br />

              Through leadership roles like chairing the GKSS Midrand Chapter and building my startup from the ground up, I've developed strong communication and project management skills. I've learned to work with diverse stakeholders, from technical teams to community leaders, and I'm comfortable presenting complex ideas in simple terms.<br /><br />

              What excites me most is the intersection of technology and business strategy. I don't just want to write code, I want to understand how technology creates value and helps organizations achieve their goals. That's why I'm drawn to consulting frameworks and business thinking alongside my technical studies.<br /><br />

              Today, I'm preparing for CISA certification while growing Themba Digital Security and working towards a career in management consulting, where I can combine my technical foundation with strategic thinking to help organizations navigate digital transformation and solve complex challenges.<br /><br />

              Because when technical understanding meets strategic thinking, and when diverse perspectives come together, that's where real innovation happens.
