            <p>I'm a final-year Computer Science student and founder of Themba Digital Security, focused on building impactful tech solutions for healthcare, education, and public service. I combine technical development with stakeholder-driven strategy to address real-world challenges.
              <br /><br />
From the Top 3-winning Healthcare Staff Secure (targeting 20+ public hospitals) to Skaftin, piloted with student housing providers, and ThreatSense Analytics, developed with input from parents and cybersecurity analysts I build with users, not just for them.
<br /><br />
As Chair of Geekulcha Student Society (Midrand), I lead a team of 7 and help bridge young talent to industry. I communicate complex systems clearly and align solutions to real needs.
<br /><br />
Currently preparing for CISA and scaling Themba Digital Security to serve African institutions with relevant, secure, and human-centered innovation.</p>
